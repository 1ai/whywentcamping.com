WhyWentCamping.com
==================

This is a redesign of the Camping website. Design decisions:

* The front page contains all information in order to get started.
* The front page links to every (offical) Camping resource.
* The news archive is for all kind of Camping related stuff.
* The reference is very simple, hand-written and with comments (no RDoc).
* **Current version**: <http://whywentcamping.judofyr.net/>

Not everything is implemented yet; see the issue tracker.
